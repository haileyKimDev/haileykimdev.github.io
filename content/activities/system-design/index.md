System Design Study Completed

I have successfully finished Alex Xu's book, 'System Design Interview,' study hosted by hashtag#WomenITs X Wooahan. 

The past two months have been very fulfilling and rewarding.
Finishing the book I bought three years ago is a big achievement, but discussing and learning with other members made it even better. 
Thanks to our leaderâ€™s great guidance and active participation from all the members, we met our initial goals and helped correct some errors in the book, which was a meaningful experience.

Starting and finishing the study at the hashtag#Insight Publishing House was especially special. It was amazing to read the book at the publisher's place and talk directly with the people who created it. 

I am also excited about our upcoming meeting with the translator, hashtag#Byungjun Lee. After finishing the first book, we are now planning to start the second book in the series.

I am really happy to have read this book with such wonderful members.
Thanks to the great members and leader, I was able to do meaningful and valuable studies. I sincerely thank all the study members!
